# Blog Page using Node.js
In this project I created a Blog page utilizing Node.js and MongoDB.

## Site Features 
This simple Blog page website allows users to post, delete, and view blogs.

## Node.js
In this project I created a server using Node.js to run and manage HTTP requests from the front-end.

## Express App
Used the Express framework to manage routing, requests, server-side logic, and http responses to serve the front-end website.

## MongoDB
I store and retrieve data using MongoDB to create dynamic web pages.

## EJS
Used EJS template engines to inject dynamic content into the HTML pages.
